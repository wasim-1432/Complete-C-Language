## 🧠 Sample Programs

```c
// Program: Check if a number is prime
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n, i, isPrime = 1;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(i = 2; i <= n/2; i++) {
        if(n % i == 0) {
            isPrime = 0;
            break;
        }
    }
    if(isPrime)
        printf("%d is a prime number.", n);
    else
        printf("%d is not a prime number.", n);
    return 0;
}
